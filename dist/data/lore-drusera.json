I closed my eyes, envisioned the entire creature in my mind, and then, when I opened my eyes…there it was, standing in front of me! It was the most wondrous thing I have ever seen, a beautiful bird with shining golden feathers. Maybe the Eldan are right. Maybe I really can do anything…</p>",

They have explained very clearly just how important I am to them, and so I am happy to do this.<p>Today was incredible! For the first time, I was allowed on the surface of the planet, and saw the endless expanse of the sky. It was breathtaking. And then, with Elyona’s help, I was able to manifest a tree using only the power of my mind! It was only a sapling, just a small and fragile thing, but Elyona said to me that it represented the greatest event in all of recorded time. I was so proud! I can’t wait to continue my studies.</p>",
