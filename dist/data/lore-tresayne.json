It is here that Life-Callers take their vows before the face of the goddess , swearing to use their ancient disciplines to protect and nurture her kingdom. Because of this, no open fire has ever burned within the walls of the temple, as fire is an uncontrollable force which maims and consumes life. Any who would bring flame to this place – and especially one of the Sisterhood – commits an act of unspeakable heresy.</p>",

Ondu serves Vitara in his own primitive way, and the Sisterhood welcomes his presence here in the sanctuary. For my part, I sleep better knowing he watches over it.
