I have always found this location to be strangely peaceful, as if the savage laws which rule this jungle are somehow inexplicably suspended here.</p><p>I am not afraid of what will transpire tomorrow. I have seen the others, and I know the risks. But I am very curious as to how I will see the world after it happens. Will I be benevolent? Vengeful? Cruel? Or will such emotions no longer have meaning for me? Perhaps the gods are beyond such petty concerns.</p>",
